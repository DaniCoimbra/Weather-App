# Weather-App

The Weather App was developed with the use of APIs to provide real-time weather information for a given location. The app offers a user-friendly and simplistic interface, displaying information like current weather, forecast, humidity, and the date/time at the browsed location. The background is also dynamically updated to display the weather and time conditions at the selected city. There is also a menu bar on the right, that displays most searched cities for easy browsing. The WeatherAPI is used to fetch weather data real time.


Using the WeatherAPI, Data is fetched and updates the current weather display.
